### Vinyl API

Demo API developed with Spring Boot to access a collection of Artists, Groups and Albums stored in a MySQL 8 Server database.

In the root of the repository you can find a Postman.json collection for the sake of testing. You will need to add an environment variable called {{baseUrl}}.

It is also deployed in a testing environment in the following URL: http://vps675475.ovh.net:9000/api/v1/collection
You can use this as your {{baseUrl}} for testing.

Swagger available at http://vps675475.ovh.net:9000/api/v1/collection/swagger-ui/
